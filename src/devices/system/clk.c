/*
 * VARCem	Virtual ARchaeological Computer EMulator.
 *		An emulator of (mostly) x86-based PC systems and devices,
 *		using the ISA,EISA,VLB,MCA  and PCI system buses, roughly
 *		spanning the era between 1981 and 1995.
 *
 *		This file is part of the VARCem Project.
 *
 *		Implement the Intel 8284 Clock Generator functionality.
 *
 *		The clock generator is responsible for providing clocks for
 *		all peripheral components on the board. Originally, it used
 *		a single crystal oscillator (the 14.3MHz one) from which all
 *		others were derived (the 1.8Mhz clock for the PIT, the 4.77M
 *		for the processor and bus, and a buffered 14.3M for the video
 *		cards) but later, a second oscillator was added, allowing for
 *		a 'turbo' mode for the processor, where the processor speed
 *		was higher than the bus and peripheral speeds.
 *
 *		On more modern systems, this functionality of course has been
 *		integrated into the chipsets.
